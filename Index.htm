        <h1> Why Travelling is Must??</h1>
    <p> Traveling can be care free or action filled, it can be budget friendly or lavish but either way I believe that both domestic and international travel are the best investments you can make in yourself. Immersing oneself in a new place can be a culture shock at first, but it forces one out of their comfort zone opening the doors for growth. “Culture and language are some of the most challenging, interesting, and enriching experiences available to individuals and collectives” (Kumpulainen 2010, 131). Through travel, one can learn about an unfamiliar culture, including their language, food, practices, and beliefs, which compel us to see past our tunneled vision of perception.<br><br>
        I believe that life is about constantly growing and learning, and personally, I feel by opening your mind to unfamiliarity you are able to grow in ways unachievable by any other matters. I agree with Kumpulainen when she writes “In today’s world, multicultural awareness, language skills and cultural knowledge as well as an appreciation of difference are necessary competences for any democratic and developing so­ciety.” Without this knowledge, we are unable to learn from each other creating a society of indistinguishable beliefs. In my opinion, broadening your mind can be one of the most personally beneficial qualities you are capable of acquiring in life. With the skill to understand and see through the eyes of different cultures, we are able to interact with people more reasonably and unselfishly. Humans are the framework of our existence; one will only get as far as they do in life with the support, assistance and interaction with other humans.
